1) Given a meme m, what are the related memes n in the dataset?
Assuming the meme m title is “I Like Turtles”

MATCH(m:meme)-[:child_to]->(n:meme) WHERE m.title = "I like turtles"  RETURN m.title, n.title

Answer: There are a total of 45 siblings and 1 parent to this particular meme.


2) Given a meme m, what are memes n and o, that form a path from m and that contain at least 2 different types of relationships?
Assuming the meme m title is “Technoviking”

MATCH (m:meme)-[r]->(n:meme)-[p]->(o:meme) WHERE m.title = "Technoviking" AND NOT type(r) = type(p) RETURN m.title, type(r),n.title, type(p), o.title

Answer: There are a total of 94 records for this meme, consisting of 2 different types of paths: a) where m is sibling to n and n is child to o, b) where m is child to n and n is parent to o. Path b) in essence maps the sibling relationship through the common parent.


3) What are the paths that lead to some memes that are grand-grandparents?

MATCH p = (m:meme)-[:child_to]->(n:meme)-[:child_to]->(o:meme)-[:child_to]->(k:meme) RETURN p


Answer: There are a total of 20 paths like this, one of the most notable grandparents being “Image macros”, which makes sense, as it is quite a general meme.
